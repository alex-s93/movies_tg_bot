@ICHbinMovieBot
It's a simple TG bot for searching films by different search criteria. 
We are given the ability to search by:
- keywords (bot will search entered values in titles and descriptions)
- name
- year
- genres (it's possible to combine several genres to search)
- year and genres (bot will search by entered year and selected genres)
- actors (bot will show you films where one of the entered actors played)

Also, users can watch the most popular search queries.
Enjoy it!

P.S.: For use don't remember to install all required dependencies from requirements.txt file :)
